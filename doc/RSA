RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages.
It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different keys.
This is also called public key cryptography, because one of the keys can be given to anyone. The other key must be kept private.
The algorithm is based on the fact that finding the factors of a large composite number is difficult:
when the factors are prime numbers, the problem is called prime factorization. It is also a key pair (public and private key) generator.
RSA involves a public key and private key. The public key can be known to everyone- it is used to encrypt messages.
Messages encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted with the private key.

The keys for the RSA algorithm are generated the following way:
1 - Choose two different large random prime numbers p and q
2 - Calculate n = p*q
3 - Calculate the totient: ϕ( n ) = (p-1)*(q-1)
    Funzione di Eulero o toziente: funzione definita come il numero degli interi compresi tra 1 e n che sono coprimi con n.
    Coprimo: I coprimi ( co-primi ) sono una coppia di interi (a,b) che hanno il massimo comune divisore uguale a 1.
4 - Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < ϕ( n ), and e is co-prime to ϕ( n ) i.e.:
    e and ϕ ( n ) share no factors other than 1; gcd( e, ϕ ( n ) ) = 1.
    e is released as the public key exponent.
5 - Compute d to satisfy the congruence relation d * e ≡ 1 ( mod ϕ ( n ) ) i.e.: d * e = 1 + x * ϕ ( n ) for some integer x.
    (Simply to say : Calculate d = ( 1 + x * ϕ ( n ) ) / e to be an integer)
    d is kept as the private key exponent.

The public key is made of the modulus n and the public exponent e.
The personal key is made of p,q and the private exponent d which must be kept secret.
(All parts of the private key must be kept secret in this form)

Encrypting message
Alice gives her public key ( n & e ) to Bob and keeps her private key secret. Bob wants to send message M to Alice.
First he turns M into a number m smaller than n by using an agreed-upon reversible protocol known as a padding scheme.
He then computes the ciphertext c corresponding to:
c = m^e mod n
Bob uses Alice's public key informations for encryption.
Bob then sends c to Alice.

Decrypting message
Alice can recover m from c by using her private key d in the following procedure:
Given m , she can recover the original distinct prime numbers, applying the Chinese remainder theorem to these two congruences yields:
m^(e*d) ≡ m mod (p * q) ===> c^d ≡ m mod n ===> m = c^d mod n

Encryption involves n and e: ciphertext = (m^e) mod n
Decryption involves n and d: plaintext = (c^d) mod n
