# Cryptot00l

This project aims to learn notions about the most important encryption algorithms.
Thanks to Python library [_pycryptodome_](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/), simple examples involving the following algorithm have been defined:
* AES
* RSA
* Salsa20
* Chacha20

*Note:* The classes related to [AES](CryptoClass/AESClass.py), [Salsa20](CryptoClass/Salsa20Class.py) and [Chacha20](CryptoClass/ChaCha20Class.py) can encrypt/decrypt messages and files, while the class related to [RSA](CryptoClass/RSAClass.py) can only encrypt/decrypt text messages.

In [doc](CryptoClass/) folder there are some notes I wrote about the various algorithms.
